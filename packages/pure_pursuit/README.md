# Short-term Slam and rear-panel detection

This experimental demo contains code aims to solve the problem that the lane filter node is not giving enough data to build a robust controller. We will often not have enough measurment of the white or yellow line and it will be difficult to input a good command. To solve this problem, we implement a buffer that can keep track of previously seen objects (in this demo we use it with the yellow and white lines) and update it at each timestamp using the speed and angular velocity that was sent to the robot.

The demo can be launched with the launch file "pure_pursuit.launch". It is possible to switch between the normal version and the augmented line detection version by uncommenting the line:

    <!-- <arg name="node_script" value="pure_pursuit_controller_node"/> -->

# Visualization

To debug the behavior of the algorithm, it is relevant to visualize the new points generated by the short-term Slam. To do so, we re-used the package "duckiebot_visualizer" and added code to publish markers for the augmented segment lists. We also added code to display the follow point for the pure_pursuit algorithm, which helped us in fine tune the controller. A package that contains the modified duckibot_visualizer (name duckiebot_visualizer_local) is included in this repo, and the launch file points to it (it also disables the visualizer from the master launch).

# Vehicle detection

To achieve the LFV challenge, vehicles need to be able to detect other vehicles on the track. This is handled using the vehicle_detection_node, whichsubscribes to the compressed image topic and publishes information about the detection. This node specifically look for a circle grid, which is displayed on the back panel of a duckiebot. At the moment that this project was done, the simulator did not include a rear-panel on the duckiebot model, so we added one to the .obj file (which was pushed to the official gym-dt repo). Moreover, the simulator did have a calibration for the fisheye, so we were not able to get good result on the circlegrid detection. To mitigate the fisheye effect, we reduced the size of the grid that we were trying to detect. Hence, the software is set to detect a line of 3x1 circle (since it is the only size that we were able to detect with the fisheye effect), though it should not be a problem anymore since the simulator now provides proper undistorting matrices. Moreover, this should not be a problem on the real robot. Hence, it is recommended to tune the grid detection parameters to the size of the grid (or maximum size that can be detected correctly).

If a duckiebot is detected, (TODO @Anthony)
